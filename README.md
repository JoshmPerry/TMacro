This code is not intended for recreation.

From my experience of entering specific keyboard inputs and the length of time they would need to run, I realized that was stupid and I wanted to be able to record the movements from my own mouse/keyboard. So, I created TMacro which with the help of TEditor (A simple text file editor) could record keyboard and mouse movements into a text file then read from the text file and recreate the actions.
